      <h2 id="Materi2">2. IMPLIED DETAIL QUESTON</h2>
      (n) Implied detail question is a type of question that requires the reader 
      or listener to infer or deduce information that is not explicitly <br> stated 
      in the given text or conversation. These questions typically rely on clues, 
      context, and the reader's background knowledge to answer them. <br> For example, let's say you 
      read a passage that describes a character arriving home, but it doesn't mention anything 
      about the character's mood. <br> An implied detail question could be: 
      <br>
      <br>
      "Based on the character's actions and the description of the setting, 
      how would you describe the character's mood <br>when they arrived home?"
      <br>
      <br>
      In this case, you have to analyze the information provided and make an inference about 
      the character's mood, even though it is not explicitly stated. <br> Implied detail questions 
      require critical thinking skills and the ability to read between the lines to understand 
      the deeper meaning or implications in <br> a text or conversation.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2 id="Materi2">2. TRANSITION QUESTION</h2>
      (n) Transition question is a type of question that help smoothly move the conversation
      from one topic ore point to another.<br>It is used to transition form one idea, subject, or
      phase of discussion to the next.<br> For example: 
      <br>
      "I think it's worth exploring another angle related to (current topic)<br>
      What do you think about?" (new angle or subtopic)
      <br>
      "That's an interesting point you made about (current topic)<br>
      Now, shifting gears a bit, i'd like to discuss, what are you thoughts on that?" (new topic)
      <br>
      <br>
      Transition question can very depending on the context and the specific purpose of the conversation.<br>

      conversation engaging and coherent.
